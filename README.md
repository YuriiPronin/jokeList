In this project, we pull random jokes into a list from https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/.

When loading the page, we get the first 10 jokes, in the future, to get and show more jokes on the page, you need to click the "Load more" button.

To add another random joke - press the ``add'' button, which appears when a joke is placed on the card.

"delete" button - deletes the selected joke

"refresh" button - deletes the selected joke and writes a new one in its place.

Also, a check for duplicate jokes works everywhere (since the jokes are random - this can happen) and excludes additional ones
